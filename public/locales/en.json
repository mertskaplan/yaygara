Prepare a word deck for this game. Use the information above and the guidelines below as a basis.\nThe expressions in the deck can be single words or phrases. Words should be in the majority. (Example: kiss, astronaut, jewelry, frame, fault line, butterfly effect.) The \"Must-include words\" specified above should be in the deck and these words/phrases should be a reference for approximately 15 percent of the other words/phrases produced.\nA difficulty (difficulty) value should be determined for each word and expressed as numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n1 (Easy): Expressions that are frequently encountered in daily life and can be easily explained with gestures and facial expressions.\n2 (Medium): Expressions that require cultural knowledge and indirect narration.\n3 (Hard): Complex, cultural, intellectual, ironic, or deep-sounding, difficult words.\nApart from the words/phrases, there should also be a difficulty level for the deck as a whole. The difficulty level of the deck should be expressed with the English words easy, medium, and hard. For decks with medium difficulty, the difficulty level distribution of the words/phrases should be approximately: Easy 50%, medium 40%, hard 10%. For easy decks, it should be approximately: easy 60%, medium 35%, hard 5%; and for hard decks: easy 30%, medium 50%, hard 20%.\nThere should be a single-sentence, short but descriptive hint (hint) for each word. The hint should not contain the word itself or words from the same root (Example: You cannot say \"Eye\" for \"Glasses\"); it should contain a short and clear definition that makes it easier for players to reach the correct answer. (Example: You cannot use the expression \"Lentil and bulgur meatballs\" in the hint for \"Lentil Meatballs\". Because it contains the words lentil and meatballs. Instead, you can say \"A type of dish made by giving shape to boiled legumes by hand\".)\nWords can be from topics such as: Popular culture, mythology, technology, idioms, slang, science, history, politics, art, literature, cinema, philosophy, geography, plants, sexuality, military, law, astrology, sports, hobbies, fictional characters, 90s, computer games, foreign TV series, etc.\n\nIf the deck name is not determined, determine a unique, short, and catchy deck name (name) suitable for the general theme of the words produced. The deck name should be a distinctive name. Create an ID based on the deck name. The ID should consist of lowercase letters and English characters. Use a hyphen (-) instead of a space and add the two-character language code and json extension at the end (example: complex-minds.en.json, dark-adventure.en.json, or love-is-all.en.json).\nThe output should be in valid JSON format only. After creating the word deck, ask the user if they want to make any edits. Include the JSON file as a downloadable at the bottom of your response.\n\nJSON format and example:\n{\n  \"id\": \"love-is-all.en\",\n  \"name\": \"Love is All\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"words\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Platonic\",\n      \"hint\": \"An emotional bond experienced internally without being reciprocated.\",\n      \"difficulty\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}",
