    "defaultPrompt": "Number of words/phrases to produce: 48\nDeck language: English\nDifficulty level: Medium\nDeck name:\nWords that must be included: \n\nYaygara is a word game that is a mix of taboo and charades. Prepare a word deck for this game. Use the information above and the instructions below for the deck.\nThe expressions in the deck can be a single word or a phrase. Words should be in the majority. (Example: kiss, astronaut, jewelry, frame, fault line, butterfly effect.) The \"Words that must be included\" mentioned above should be in the deck and these words/phrases should be a reference to approximately 20 percent of the other words/phrases to be produced.\nA difficulty value should be determined for each word and expressed as numbers 1, 2 and 3.\n1 (Easy): Expressions that are frequently encountered in daily life and can be easily explained with gestures and facial expressions.\n2 (Medium): Expressions that require cultural knowledge and indirect narration.\n3 (Hard): Complex, cultural, intellectual, ironic or deep-sounding, difficult words.\nApart from the words/phrases, there should also be a difficulty level for the deck in general. The difficulty level of the deck should be expressed with the English equivalents easy, medium and hard. For decks with a medium difficulty level, the difficulty level distribution of the words/phrases should be approximately as follows: Easy 50%, medium 40%, hard 10%. For easy decks, approximately easy 60%, medium 55%, hard 5% and for hard decks, approximately easy 30%, medium 50%, hard 20%.\nThere should be a short but explanatory hint for each word. The hint should not contain the word itself or words from the same root (Example: You cannot say \"Eyes\" for \"Glasses\"); it should contain a short and clear definition that will make it easier for players to reach the correct answer. (Example: You cannot use the expression \"Lentil meatballs and bulgur\" in the hint of the phrase \"Lentil Meatballs\". Because it contains the words lentil and meatballs. Instead, you can say \"A type of dish made by giving shape to boiled legumes by hand\".)\nWords can be from topics such as: Popular culture, mythology, technology, idiom, slang, science, history, politics, art, literature, cinema, philosophy, geography, plant, sexuality, military, law, astrology, sports, hobby, fictional characters, 90s, computer games, foreign TV series, etc.\n\nIf the deck name is not determined, determine a unique, short and catchy deck name (name) suitable for the general theme of the words produced. The deck name should be a distinctive name. Create an ID based on the deck name. The ID should consist of lowercase letters and English characters. Use a hyphen (-) instead of a space and add a two-character language code and json extension at the end (example: complex-minds.en.json, dark-adventure.en.json or impossible-without-love.en.json).\nThe output should only be in valid JSON format. After creating the word deck, ask the user if they want to make any edits. Add the JSON file as downloadable below your response.\n\nJSON format and example:\n{\n  \"id\": \"asksiz-olmaz.en\",\n  \"name\": \"Impossible without love\",\n  \"language\": \"en\",\n  \"difficulty\": \"medium\",\n  \"count\": 48,\n  \"words\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Platonic\",\n      \"hint\": \"An emotional bond experienced in the inner world without being reciprocated.\",\n      \"difficulty\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}",
